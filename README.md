# Hi there 👋

My name is Artyom and I'm a system and technical game designer at Ciliz.

Game systems, mechanics, scripting and boss fights are my passion.

You can learn more about my experience in my [*CV*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cWguLDwXgFBUwuQruIbkiXVI8ffUWL8N/view?usp=sharing).

# Game jams 🕹️

In addition, I'm a game jam enthusiast, every year I participate in [**LudumDare**](www.ldjam.com) and GMTKjam.

You can find my jam games on my [**itch.io page**](https://tricky-fat-cat.itch.io/).

# Programming 💻

I'm not a professional programmer, however, I'm keen on developing my coding skills. It's fun and also very useful at work and game jams!

Currently, I spend my spare time learning C++ and UE4. Besides, I'm working on [**a plugin for rapid prototyping in UE4**](https://github.com/TrickyFatCat/TrickyPrototyping).

I also have a [**simple template project**](https://github.com/TrickyFatCat/game-jam-template) for prototyping in Godot engine.
