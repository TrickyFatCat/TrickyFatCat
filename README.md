## üïπÔ∏è Game designer

I've been working as a game designer for about 11 years; and specialize in system and technical game design.

I'm pattionate about designing, balancing, and prototyping gameplay mechanics, enemies AI, boss fights and combat systems using both visual scripting languages and text-based programming languages such as Blueprints and C++ respectively.

You can learn more about my experience in my [**CV**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cWguLDwXgFBUwuQruIbkiXVI8ffUWL8N/view?usp=sharing).

### :loudspeaker: Speaker

Moreover, I'm keen on helping beginners to become game designers.

As a result, I'm a regular speaker at game development conferences, especially DevGAMM, where I deliver various speeches about game design.

### :space_invader: Game jams enthusiast

In addition, I'm a game jam enthusiast, every year I participate in [**LudumDare**](https://ldjam.com/users/tricky-fat-cat/games) and GMTKjam.

You can also find my jam games on my [**itch.io page**](https://tricky-fat-cat.itch.io/).

## üíª Programming

I'm not a professional programmer, however, I'm keen on developing my coding skills. It's fun and also very useful at work and game jams!

Currently, studying C++ and UE4 is my primary activity during my spare time.
