# Hi there üëã

My name is Artyom and I'm a system and technical game designer at Ciliz.

Game systems, mechanics, scripting and boss fights are my passion.

You can learn more about my experience in my [**CV**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cWguLDwXgFBUwuQruIbkiXVI8ffUWL8N/view?usp=sharing).

# Game jams üïπÔ∏è

In addition, I'm a game jam enthusiast, every year I participate in [**LudumDare**](https://ldjam.com/users/tricky-fat-cat/games) and GMTKjam.

You can find my jam games on my [**itch.io page**](https://tricky-fat-cat.itch.io/).

# Programming üíª

I'm not a professional programmer, however, I'm keen on developing my coding skills. It's fun and also very useful at work and game jams!

Currently, studying C++ and UE4 is my primary activity during my spare time.
